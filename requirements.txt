# Core dependencies
# NOTE: Do NOT install opencv-python via pip if you have built OpenCV from source
# with CUDA support. The custom-built cv2.pyd should be placed directly in your
# venv's site-packages instead (see README.md).
#
# If you are running on a machine WITHOUT a CUDA-capable GPU (e.g. a laptop with
# integrated graphics only), uncomment the line below and skip the source build:
# opencv-python==4.10.0.84
